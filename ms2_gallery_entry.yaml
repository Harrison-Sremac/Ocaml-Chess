  This will be very similar to the New York Timesâ€™ Spelling Bee game. The user will be given seven letters, with one letter highlighted in a different color. Then, the user can make as many words as possible with any combination of letters, as long as it includes the highlighted letter. The more words that the user can make, the more points they will get. They will reach the max level if they get all of the possible words.
  We will also add the option for users to adjust their game's difficulty, allowing them to control the number of letters they are permitted to use.
